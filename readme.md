Django User Profiles

A flexible app that wires together Django's user authentication and user profile features, with customizable forms and models.

You can configure this app to implement various login/signup paradigms:

* Sign up with username and email – confirm email address – proceed to log in with generated password *TODO*
* Sign up with email and password – confirm email address – proceed to log in
* Sign up with email and password – proceed to log in – confirm email address later to use advanced features
* Sign up with username and password – proceed to log in – add email address later – confirm email address
* etc.


TODO: Document how user can have several profiles.
