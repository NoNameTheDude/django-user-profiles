    """
    An abstract base class for your custom user profile model, defining a few
    commonly used methods, as well as the field :attr:`is_default` which enables
    you to implement a multiple-profiles-per-user feature.
    
    That field is a boolean specifying whether a specific instance is a user's
    default profile and thus will be returned by that user's ``get_profile()``
    method.

    .. note::
       If in your project every user only has one profile, you can just ignore
       the ``is_default`` field.
    
    When you subclass this class, the default ``Manager`` of your custom user
    profile model (:attr:`objects`) will only return instances whose
    ``is_default`` attribute is ``True``, that is, by default a call to
    ``MyProfileModel.objects.all()`` will only return the default profile for
    each user. See the :attr:`by_current_user` ``Manager`` for information on
    how to access all of an individual user's profiles, or :attr:`by_any_user`
    for access to any profile.

    Instead of using :attr:`by_any_user`, you can also create a proxy model of
    your user profile model, whose default ``Manager`` will give you access to
    all user profile instances. Such a proxy model could be linked to a
    ``ModelAdmin``, since site administrators would typically need access to all
    profiles instead of just one individual user's profiles.
    
    .. warning::
       If you are implementing a multiple-profiles-per-user feature in your
       project, you should prevent users from deleting their default profile by
       checking first whether ``is_default`` is ``True``. When creating
       additonal profiles for a user, you also need to make sure that the
       ``is_default`` field is ``True`` for exactly one profile object so as not
       to create any ambiguities that lead to errors.
